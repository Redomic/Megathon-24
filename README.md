A toolkit for government agencies to monitor terrain changes across vast areas in real-time, with a focus on detecting unauthorized man-made alterations while filtering out natural variations like water, snow, and forest cover. Leveraging Sentinel-1 SAR satellite data and advanced edge detection techniques, the platform provides minimal false alarms and gives officials the flexibility to adjust thresholds for precise change detection. With integrated generative AI, the system can summarize unstructured data, identify trends, and support decision-making, making it an invaluable tool for government agencies like NTRO, DRDO and other government agencies in safeguarding critical infrastructure and national borders.
